# Scratchpad — Short-Term

Temporary working context. **Clean up aggressively — delete when resolved.** Rules: `agent_docs/memory_process.md`.

## Current Work

- **Read-only settings dropdowns** (branch `claude/settings-fields-read-only-qmrf9z`) — the editable Whisper-model combo (Settings + onboarding wizard) saved any typed text verbatim as the model id; the user hit this (typo → nonexistent model, failure only at load). Both combos are now non-editable; custom CTranslate2 ids go through a new "Custom model id (Hugging Face)…" sentinel entry that opens a QInputDialog (`settings_ui._on_model_activated`); gui_smoke asserts non-editability + that the sentinel never resolves to a value.

## Research Notes

- **Faster STT models + near-realtime translation** (2026-07-23): full report in `docs/research/2026-07-faster-stt-and-translation.md` (branch `claude/faster-translation-models-y5nn6p`). Headlines: `primeline/whisper-large-v3-turbo-german` = −28 % German WER at identical speed (string-only preset add); official `distil-whisper/distil-large-v3.5-ct2` upgrades the EN distil preset; Parakeet-TDT-0.6b-v3 via `onnx-asr` ≈ 20× faster with German ≥ turbo (candidate 3rd backend); the app has NO translation feature yet — cheapest real one is Whisper `task="translate"` (→EN only; **broken on turbo/distil** — silently returns source language) then Opus-MT de↔en on the already-shipped CTranslate2 (<150 ms CPU). License traps: CrisperWhisper/NLLB/SeamlessM4T/Tower+ are CC-BY-NC — never ship. No Whisper large-v4 exists.
- **Hardware acceleration beyond CUDA** (2026-07-20): CTranslate2/faster-whisper supports NVIDIA CUDA + CPU only — no Intel GPU, no NPU, no ROCm planned. Best path for Intel iGPU/Arc/NPU: **OpenVINO GenAI `WhisperPipeline`** (`pip install openvino-genai`, device `"CPU"|"GPU"|"NPU"`, pre-converted models on HF under `OpenVINO/whisper-*-ov`, NPU works out of the box since 2025.1). Alternative for vendor-neutral GPU (incl. AMD): whisper.cpp via `pywhispercpp` with Vulkan — but PyPI wheels are CPU-only, would need own CI wheel build; no NPU. ONNX Runtime DirectML is in maintenance mode (successor: Windows ML) — not worth adopting. AMD Ryzen AI NPU needs its own heavyweight SW stack; Qualcomm NPU needs an ARM64 build — both out of scope. Integration idea: `backend` config key (`faster-whisper` | `openvino`) + optional dependency, lazy import, separate model cache (OpenVINO IR format ≠ CT2 format).
